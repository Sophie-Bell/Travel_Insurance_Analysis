# Insurance-Claim-Prediction-and-Analysis
## Objective:
The objective of this project is **to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess and predict whether an insurance claim should be issued to a policyholder or not.** This model aims to provide an automated and data-driven decision-making process for insurance companies, streamlining the claims processing workflow and ensuring fair and accurate claim approvals.

## Project Description :open_file_folder:
In this project I will do the following:

- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents

- Clean the data, handle missing values

- Apply data visualization techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the dataset.

- Employ hypothesis testing to explore relationships and associations within the dataset.

- Address critical questions such as:

    - Are self-employed individuals more likely to have higher incomes compared to those in the private sector?

    - Does the number of family members influence the decision to purchase travel insurance?

    - Are individuals with chronic diseases more inclined to buy travel insurance?

    - Is there a significant difference in the proportion of people who have traveled abroad between those with and without travel insurance?

- Use various statistical tests, including t-tests, chi-squared tests, and proportions tests, to assess hypotheses and determine the significance of observed relationships.


- Train the model on the data to predict the likelihood of claim approval based on policyholder information and claim details

- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Data Source :bar_chart:
The **raw dataset** comes from the [Travel Insurance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data). The "Travel Insurance Data" is a comprehensive collection of data that provides insights into the travel insurance industry.

This dataframe contains 9 variables that correspond to:

**Age:** Age Of The Customer

**Employment Type** The Sector In Which Customer Is Employed

**GraduateOrNot:** Whether The Customer Is College Graduate Or Not

**AnnualIncome:** The Yearly Income Of The Customer In Indian Rupees[Rounded To Nearest 50 Thousand Rupees]

**FamilyMembers:** Number Of Members In Customer's Family

**ChronicDisease:** Whether The Customer Suffers From Any Major Disease Or Conditions Like Diabetes/High BP or Asthama,etc.

**FrequentFlyer:** Derived Data Based On Customer's History Of Booking Air Tickets On Atleast 4 Different Instances in the Years[2017-2019].

**EverTravelledAbroad:** Has The Customer Ever Travelled To A Foreign Country[Not Necessarily Using The Company's Services]

**TravelInsurance:** Did The Customer Buy Travel Insurance Package During Introductory Offering Held In The Year 2019.


## Results :star:
The results of our analysis reveal intriguing insights into the dataset. Firstly, we found evidence indicating that non-government employee individuals have a significantly higher average annual income compared to those in the private sector. Secondly, our findings suggest that the number of family members does play a pivotal role in influencing the choice to acquire travel insurance. This highlights the impact of family size on insurance decisions.Contrarily, our analysis led to the conclusion that there is no substantial association between chronic diseases and travel insurance, as we failed to reject the null hypothesis in this case. Lastly, the analysis revealed a strong association between traveling abroad and the decision to purchase travel insurance. This highlights the significance of past travel experiences in shaping insurance choices. 
 
 ***These results collectively provide valuable insights for both the insurance industry and potential travelers, enhancing our understanding of the factors influencing travel insurance decisions.***
